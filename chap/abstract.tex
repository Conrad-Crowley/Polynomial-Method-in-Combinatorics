    Polynomial methods are an emerging set of techniques in Combinatorics which use elementary facts about polynomials to control the size of collections of objects with a certain structure. 
    We present an exposition on polynomial methods via a collection of results that can be elegantly proven with them, ranging from the solution to the Finite Field Kakeya Problem to bounds on the number of circle tangencies in the plane. For the latter problem we also provide a new proof.
