\section*{Acknowledgements}
I am greatly indebted to my supervisor Marco Vitturi
for his time, guidance, and enthusiasm throughout this research endeavour.
He has been extremely helpful throughout, far exceeding any expectations that could be reasonably set of a Bachelor's thesis supervisor.

I would like to thank Anca Mustata for some helpful conversations regarding the Real Algebraic Geometry considerations of Chapter \ref*{chap:circle}.

I would also like to thank the second reader Andrei Mustata for taking the time to read and evaluate this (rather long) manuscript. 

Further, gratitude must be expressed for the UCC Mathematics department without whom this extremely enjoyable experience would not have been possible.
Special thanks should be given to the module coordinator Kevin Hayes who has been working diligently behind the scenes throughout the year to ensure this module progressed smoothly.
