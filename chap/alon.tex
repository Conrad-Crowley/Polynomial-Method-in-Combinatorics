\chapter{The Polynomial Method in Additive Combinatorics \label{chap:alon}}
So far our discussion has only centred around the usefulness of polynomial methods in geometric combinatorial problems. 
In this chapter we shall discuss applications to the exciting field of additive combinatorics, where in 1990 Alon provided perhaps
the first example of the polynomial method in action.\cite{alon1999combinatorial} We present Michalek's short, elementary, and direct proof of the combinatorial nullstellensatz.\cite{michalek2010}
\section{Combinatorial Nullstellensatz}
\begin{theorem}[Combinatorial Nullstellensatz]
    Let $\KK$ be a (not necessarily finite) field, and let $P(X_1,\dots, X_n) \in \KK[X_1,\dots, X_n]$ be a polynomial in $n$ variables with coefficients in $\KK$. Suppose the coefficient of $x_1^{k_1}x_2^{k_2}\dots x_n^{k_n}$ is non-zero and further suppose $\deg P = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i$, where each $k_i$ is a non-negative integer.

    Then for any subsets $A_1,\dots A_n$ of $\KK$ satisfying $|A_i| > k_i$ for each $1\leq i\leq n$ there exist $a_1 \in A_1, \dots, a_n \in A_n$ such that $P(a_1,\dots, a_n) \neq 0$.
    \label{comb-nullstellensatz}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We proceed by induction on $\deg P = D$. When $D=1$, $P$ is simply a linear combination of $n$ variables say $P(X_1,\dots X_m) = c_1 X_1 + \dots c_n X_n$. Without loss of generality assume $x_1$ has a non-zero coefficient and consider the sets $A_i = \{a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}\}$. Suppose $P$ at the point $(a_{1,1}, a_{2,1}, \dots, a_{n,1})$ is zero. We can then determine $c_{1} =- \frac{c_2 a_{2,1} + c_3 a_{3,1}+\dots+ c_n a_{n,1}}{a_{1,1}}$. Now evaluating at $(a_{1,2}, a_{2,1}, \dots, a_{n,1})$ we see that this is zero only when $a_{1,1} = a_{1,2}$, so our theorem holds. 

    Now let us assume the theorem holds for $\deg P = D -1$, and prove for $\deg P = D$.
    Suppose that $P$ satisfies the assumptions of the theorem but $P(x) = 0$ for every $x \in A_1 \times \dots \times A_n$.
    Without loss of generality $k_1 > 0.$ Fixing $a\in A_1$ we can write
    \[
    P = (x_1-a)Q +R  \tag{$\dagger$}
    \]
    by the usual long division of polynomials. The degree of $R$ in $x_1$ must be strictly less than $\deg(x_1-a)$, so $R$ does not contain any
    $x_1$ terms. Thus it follows that $Q$ must have a monomial with non-zero coefficient of the form $x_1^{k_{1} -1} x_2^{k_2} \dots x_n^{k_n}$ and 
    $\deg (Q) = D-1$.

    Take any $x \in \{a\} \times A_2 \times \dots \times A_n$ and evaluate $(\dagger)$. Since $P(x) = 0$ it follows that $R(x) = 0$, but $R$ is independent of $x_1$ so $R$ must also vanish on $A_1 \backslash \{a\} \times A_2 \times \dots \times A_n$.
    Now take any $x \in A_1 \backslash \{a\} \times A_2 \times \dots \times A_n$ and evaluate $(\dagger)$. Since $(x_1 - a)$ is non-zero, $Q(x) =0$. So $Q$ vanishes on all $x \in A_1 \backslash \{a\} \times A_2 \times \dots \times A_n$, which contradicts the inductive hypothesis.
\end{proof}
\section{Cauchy-Davenport Theorem}
\begin{theorem} [Cauchy-Davenport Theorem]
    Let $A,B$ be non-empty subsets of $\ZZ_p$ for some $p$ prime. Define their sumset $A+B$ as follows:
    \[
    A + B = 
    \left\{ x \in \ZZ_p\ | \ x = a+b \text{  for some } a\in A, \ b \in B \right\}.
    \]
    Then we have:
    \[
    |A+B| \geq  \min \left\{p, |A| + |B| -1 \right\}.
    \]
\end{theorem} \todo{Generalise this!}

\begin{proof}
    Let us tackle the two cases separately. First, assume that $\min \left\{p, |A| + |B| -1 \right\} = p$.
    Then if $|A| + |B| > p$, $A$ and $B$ must intersect. \todo{ More explanation on $\cap$ needed? PHP?}
    For some $g \in \ZZ_p$ denote the set  $\left\{ g - x  \ | \ x \in B, \  \right\} \subset \ZZ_p$ as $g-B$. Since $|g-B| = |B|$, we have that 
    $g-B$ and $A$ must intersect as well. Thus there exists some $a \in A$, $b \in B$ such that: 
    \begin{align*}
        g& -b = a \\
        g& = a+b.
    \end{align*}
    Our choice of $g$ was arbitrary, so it follows that $A+B = \ZZ_p$ and hence $|A+B| = p$.

    Now assume that $\min \left\{p, |A| + |B| -1 \right\} = |A| + |B| -1$. Then if the theorem is false we have $|A+B| \leq |A| + |B| -2$, so there exists some $C \subset \ZZ_p$ such that 
    $A+B \subset C$ and $|C| =  |A| + |B| -2$. Now let us define a polynomial $f(x,y) \in \ZZ_p [x,y]$ as:
    \[
        f(x,y) = \prod_{c \in C} (x+y -c).
    \]
    Since $A+B \subset C$, $f(a,b) =0$ for all $(a,b) \in A\times B$. Further, the degree of $f$ is $\deg f = |C| = |A| + |B| -2$. 
    We can now appeal to the combinatorial nullstellensatz to yield a contradiction. Let $k_1 = |A| -1$, and $k_2 = |B|-1$. 
    Now $\deg f = k_1 + k_2$, and the coefficient of $x^{k_1}y^{k_2}$ is
    ${|A|+|B| - 2} \choose {|A|- 1}$ which is non-zero in $\ZZ_p$ as the numerator cannot contain a factor of $p$ by assumption. Applying Theorem \ref{comb-nullstellensatz} we see that there 
    must exist some $(a,b) \in A \times B$ such that $f(a,b) \neq 0$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}
